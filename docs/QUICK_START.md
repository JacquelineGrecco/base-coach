# 🚀 Quick Start Guide

## What Changed?

Based on your meeting with Fernanda on Nov 25, I've implemented ALL the features you discussed!

---

## 🎯 3 Main Changes

### 1️⃣ **Select Up to 3 Criteria Per Session** (NEW!)

**Before:** Had to evaluate ALL 8 valences every time
**Now:** Pick 1-3 criteria to focus on

```
Dashboard → "Start New Session" → SELECT CRITERIA → Start
```

**Why?** Fernanda said: *"focar em no máximo três critérios por vez... para avaliar 23 atletas em 1 hora"*

---

### 2️⃣ **Super Fast Evaluation** (IMPROVED!)

**Before:** Small buttons, no shortcuts
**Now:** 
- ⌨️ **Arrow keys** (← →) to switch players
- 📱 **Swipe** left/right on mobile
- 🎯 **Bigger buttons** (easier to tap)
- ⚡ **Only 3 criteria** (not 8)

**Result:** Evaluate each player in **under 1 minute** instead of 2-3 minutes!

---

### 3️⃣ **Individual Reports** (NEW!)

**Before:** No reports generated
**Now:** 
- 📄 **Auto-generated** 200-300 character reports
- 💪 Shows **strengths** (scores ≥ 4.0)
- ⚠️ Shows **weaknesses** (scores ≤ 2.5)
- 📥 **Download** as .txt file
- 📤 **Share** directly (mobile)
- 💰 **Premium unlock** for selling to parents

**Why?** Fernanda said: *"relatórios de 200 a 300 caracteres... que poderiam ser vendidos aos pais"*
